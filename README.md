## System Design Roadmap for Beginners (Zero to Hero)

System design is crucial for anyone aspiring to work, especially with major companies which are now focusing on system design interviews as a critical part of the hiring process. Understanding system design is not just for seasoned engineers—it's an essential skill for beginners too. Whether you are just starting your journey in software development or aiming to strengthen your expertise, this guide will walk you through the process of mastering system design from the fundamentals all the way to advanced concepts.

### Phase 1: Understanding System Design Foundations

In this phase, you'll learn the fundamental concepts of system design that will form the base for all your learning. This is where you begin your journey to understanding how large systems are built and why they function the way they do.

#### 1. Why System Design Is Important

In today's software industry, scalable, reliable, and efficient systems are the backbone of successful applications. Every major tech company (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc.) includes system design interviews to assess a candidate's ability to architect complex systems.

Reasons to learn system design:
- It helps you understand how systems work at scale.
- It enhances your ability to build efficient, maintainable, and fault-tolerant systems.
- It gives you an edge in job interviews and sets you apart from other candidates.

#### 2. What is System Design?

System Design is the process of planning and defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flow of a system to meet specific requirements. It ensures scalability, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability.

##### Types of System Design (Instagram Example):

- **High-Level System Design (HLD):**
  - Focuses on components like User Management, Post Management, Feed Generator, Notifications.

- **Low-Level System Design (LLD):**
  - Focuses on database design, image storage, and data handling within Post Management.

#### 3. Key Concepts in System Design:

- **Scalability**: Growth in capacity with demand.
- **Availability**: System is operational at all times.
- **CAP Theorem**: Balancing Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
- **ACID Transactions**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
- **Reliability**: Functioning even in failure.
- **Maintainability**: Easy to modify and test.

#### 4. Common Terminologies:

- **Rate Limiting**: Limits user request count.
- **Fault Tolerance**: System functions despite failure.
- **SPOF**: Single failure point disrupting the system.

### Phase 2: Core Building Blocks of System Design

Dive deeper into building blocks like APIs, databases, and scalability.

#### 1. APIs & Communication Models

- **APIs**: Communication between systems.
- **HTTP & Request-Response**: Core web communication.
- **REST vs RPC**: Style vs procedure calls.
- **WebSockets, Polling, SSE**: Real-time communication.
- **Push vs Pull**: Server to client vs client to server updates.

#### 2. Databases and Storage

- **SQL vs NoSQL**: Structured vs flexible storage.
- **Indexes**: Faster data retrieval.
- **Sharding**: Splitting large databases.
- **Replication**: Data redundancy across servers.

#### 3. Load Handling

- **Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling**: More power vs more machines.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic.

### Phase 3: Advanced Scalability and Performance Optimization

Focus on maintaining performance and availability under load.

#### 1. Fault Tolerance and Consistency

- **Consistent Hashing**: Efficient data distribution.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Isolate failing components.
- **High Availability & Disaster Recovery**: Quick recovery strategies.

#### 2. Advanced Load Balancing

- **Proxy vs Reverse Proxy**: Forward vs routing requests.
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for APIs.

### Phase 4: Architecting Large-Scale Distributed Systems

Understand how to manage complexity and scale.

#### 1. Microservices Architecture
- Small, independently deployable services.

#### 2. Serverless Architecture
- Cloud-managed backend infrastructure.

#### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- Systems reacting to real-time events.

#### 4. Peer-to-Peer Architecture
- Decentralized node-to-node communication.

---

### Phase 5: Designing Real-World Systems

Apply knowledge to real-world challenges.

#### 1. Case Study: Ride-Sharing System
- Match riders and drivers.
- Handle real-time data and high traffic.

#### 2. System Design Patterns
- **Client-Server**: Request-response model.
- **Microservices & Serverless**: Modular and scalable systems.

#### 3. System Design Trade-offs
- Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling
- Concurrency vs. Parallelism
- Batch vs. Stream Processing
- Stateful vs. Stateless
- Strong vs. Eventual Consistency
- Push vs. Pull

#### 4. Design Examples
- **URL Shortener**: Bit.ly
- **Chat App**: WhatsApp
- **Social Media**: Instagram/Twitter
- **File Storage**: Google Drive

Focus areas:
- Data modeling
- Service design
- Scaling techniques
- Fault tolerance & backup

#### 5. System Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Logging**: Track behavior.
- **Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog.
- **Alerting**: Get notified on failures.
- **Postmortems**: Learn from failures.
